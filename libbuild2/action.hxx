  // While we are using uint8_t for the meta/operation ids, we assume that
  // each is limited to 4 bits (max 15 entries @@ this is probably too low) so
  // that we can store the combined action id in uint8_t as well. This makes
  // our life easier when it comes to defining switch labels for action ids
  // (no need to mess with endian-ness).
  //
  // Note that 0 is not a valid meta/operation/action id.

  // Meta-operations and operations are not the end of the story. We also have
  // operation nesting (currently only one level deep) which is used to
  // implement pre/post operations (currently, but may be useful for other
  // things). Here is the idea: the test operation needs to make sure that the
  // targets that it needs to test are up-to-date. So it runs update as its
  // pre-operation. It is almost like an ordinary update except that it has
  // test as its outer operation (the meta-operations are always the same).
  // This way a rule can recognize that this is "update for test" and do
  // something differently. For example, if an executable is not a test, then
  // there is no use updating it. At the same time, most rules will ignore the
  // fact that this is a nested update and for them it is "update as usual".
  //
  // This inner/outer operation support is implemented by maintaining two
  // independent "target states" (see target::state; initially we tried to do
  // it via rule/recipe override but that didn't end up well, to put it
  // mildly). While the outer operation normally "directs" the inner, inner
  // rules can still be matched/executed directly, without outer's involvement
  // (e.g., because of dependencies in other inner rules). A typical
  // implementation of an outer rule either returns noop or delegates to the
  // inner rule. In particular, it should not replace or override the inner's
  // logic.
  //
  // While most of the relevant target state is duplicated, certain things are
  // shared among the inner/outer rules, such as the target data pad and the
  // group state. In particular, it is assumed the group state is always
  // determined by the inner rule (see resolve_members()).
  //
  // Normally, an outer rule will be responsible for any additional, outer
  // operation-specific work. Sometimes, however, the inner rule needs to
  // customize its behavior. In this case the outer and inner rules must
  // communicate this explicitly (normally via the target's data pad) and
  // there is a number of restrictions to this approach. See
  // cc::{link,install}_rule for details.

  // Recipe execution mode.
  //
  // When a target is a prerequisite of another target, its recipe can be
  // executed before the dependent's recipe (the normal case) or after.
  // We will call these "front" and "back" execution modes, respectively
  // (think "the prerequisite is 'front-running' the dependent").
  //
  // There could also be several dependent targets and the prerequisite's
  // recipe can be execute as part of the first dependent (the normal
  // case) or last (or for all/some of them; see the recipe execution
  // protocol in <target>). We will call these "first" and "last"
  // execution modes, respectively.
  //
  // Now you may be having a hard time imagining where a mode other than
  // the normal one (first/front) could be useful. An the answer is,
  // compensating or inverse operations such as clean, uninstall, etc.
  // If we use the last/back mode for, say, clean, then we will remove
  // targets in the order inverse to the way they were updated. While
  // this sounds like an elegant idea, are there any practical benefits
  // of doing it this way? As it turns out there is (at least) one: when
  // we are removing a directory (see fsdir{}), we want to do it after
  // all the targets that depend on it (such as files, sub-directories)
  // were removed. If we do it before, then the directory won't be empty
  // yet.
  //
  // It appears that this execution mode is dictated by the essence of
  // the operation. Constructive operations (those that "do") seem to
  // naturally use the first/front mode. That is, we need to "do" the
  // prerequisite first before we can "do" the dependent. While the
  // destructive ones (those that "undo") seem to need last/back. That
  // is, we need to "undo" all the dependents before we can "undo" the
  // prerequisite (say, we need to remove all the files before we can
  // remove their directory).
  //
  // If you noticed the parallel with the way C++ construction and
  // destruction works for base/derived object then you earned a gold
  // star!
  //
  // Note that the front/back mode is realized in the dependen's recipe
  // (which is another indication that it is a property of the operation).
