    // Target group to which this target belongs, if any. Note that we assume
    // that the group and all its members are in the same scope (for example,
    // in variable lookup). We also don't support nested groups (with an
    // exception for ad hoc groups; see below).
    //
    // The semantics of the interaction between the group and its members and
    // what it means to, say, update the group, is unspecified and is
    // determined by the group's type. In particular, a group can be created
    // out of member types that have no idea they are part of this group
    // (e.g., cli.cxx{}).
    //
    // Normally, however, there are two kinds of groups: "all" and "choice".
    // In a choice-group, normally one of the members is selected when the
    // group is mentioned as a prerequisite with, perhaps, an exception for
    // special rules, like aliases, where it makes more sense to treat such
    // group prerequisites as a whole. In this case we say that the rule
    // "semantically recognizes" the group and picks some of its members.
    //
    // Updating a choice-group as a whole can mean updating some subset of its
    // members (e.g., lib{}). Or the group may not support this at all (e.g.,
    // obj{}).
    //
    // In an all-group, when a group is updated, normally all its members are
    // updates (and usually with a single command), though there could be some
    // members that are omitted, depending on the configuration (e.g., an
    // inline file not/being generated). When an all-group is mentioned as a
    // prerequisite, the rule is usually interested in the individual members
    // rather than the whole group. For example, a C++ compile rule would like
    // to "see" the ?xx{} members when it gets a cli.cxx{} group.
    //
    // Which brings us to the group iteration mode. The target type contains a
    // member called see_through that indicates whether the default iteration
    // mode for the group should be "see through"; that is, whether we see the
    // members or the group itself. For the iteration support itself, see the
    // *_prerequisite_members() machinery below.
    //
    // In an all-group we usually want the state (and timestamp; see mtime())
    // for members to come from the group. This is achieved with the special
    // target_state::group state. You would normally also use the group_recipe
    // for group members.
    //
    // Note that the group-member link-up can happen anywhere between the
    // member creation and rule matching so reading the group before the
    // member has been matched can be racy.
    //
    const target* group = nullptr;

    // What has been described above is an "explicit" group. That is, there is
    // a dedicated target type that explicitly serves as a group and there is
    // an explicit mechanism for discovering the group's members.
    //
    // However, sometimes, we may want to create a group on the fly out of a
    // normal target type. For example, we have the libs{} target type. But
    // on Windows a shared library consist of (at least) two files: the import
    // library and the DLL itself. So we somehow need to be able to capture
    // that. One approach would be to imply the presence of the second file.
    // However, that means that a lot of generic rules (e.g., clean, install,
    // etc) will need to know about this special semantics on Windows. Also,
    // there would be no convenient way to customize things like extensions,
    // etc (for which we use target-specific variables). In other words, it
    // would be much easier and more consistent to make these extra files
    // proper targets.
    //
    // So to support this requirement we have ad hoc groups. The idea is that
    // any target can be turned either by a user's declaration in a buildfile
    // or by the rule that matches it into an ad hoc group by chaining several
    // targets together.
    //
    // Ad hoc groups have a more restricted semantics compared to the normal
    // groups. In particular:
    //
    // - The ad hoc group itself is in a sense its first/primary target.
    //
    // - Group member's recipes, if set, should be group_recipe. Normally, a
    //   rule-managed member isn't matched by the rule since all that's
    //   usually needed is to derive its path.
    //
    // - Unless declared, members are discovered lazily, they are only known
    //   after the group's rule's apply() call.
    //
    // - Only declared members can be used as prerequisites but all can be
    //   used as targets (e.g., to set variables, etc).
    //
    // - Members don't have prerequisites.
    //
    // - Ad hoc group cannot have sub-groups (of any kind) though an ad hoc
    //   group can be a sub-group of an explicit group.
    //
    // - Member variable lookup skips the ad hoc group (since the group is the
    //   first member, this is normally what we want).
    //
    // Note that ad hoc groups can be part of explicit groups. In a sense, we
    // have a two-level grouping: an explicit group with its members each of
    // which can be an ad hoc group. For example, lib{} contains libs{} which
    // may have an import stub as its ad hoc member.

  // /usr/share/man/man1) as well as the extension of the file
  // (e.g., test.1). Note also that there could be sub-sections,
  // e.g., 1p (for POSIX). Such a page would still go into man1
  // but will have the .1p extension (at least that's what happens
  // on Linux). The challenge is to somehow handle this in a
  // portable manner. So here is the plan:
  //
  // First of all, we have the man{} target type which can be used
  // for a custom man page. That is, you can have any extension and
  // install it anywhere you please:
  //
  // man{foo.X}: install = man/manX
  //
  // Then we have man1..9{} target types which model the "sane"
  // section set and that would be automatically installed into
  // correct locations on other platforms. In other words, the
  // idea is that you should be able to have the foo.8 file,
  // write man8{foo} and have it installed as man1m/foo.1m on
  // some SysV host.
  //
  // Re-mapping the installation directory is easy: to help with
  // that we have assigned install.man1..9 directory names. The
  // messy part is to change the extension. It seems the only
  // way to do that would be to have special logic for man pages
  // in the generic install rule. @@ This is still a TODO.
